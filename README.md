## Hypotheses/Questions 

1. Age and Addiction: Younger students are more likely to have higher social media addiction scores.

2. Gender Differences: Female and male students differ in social media addiction levels.

3. Academic Level: Students at lower academic levels (e.g., Freshman) have higher addiction scores than students at higher levels.

4. Sleep and Mental Health: Higher social media usage and fewer sleep hours are associated with worse mental health scores.

5. Most Used Platform: Students who use certain platforms more frequently have higher addiction scores.




## Visualization Plan
