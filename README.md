'Job_Title', 'Average_Salary', 'Years_Experience', 'Education_Level',
       'AI_Exposure_Index', 'Tech_Growth_Factor',
       'Automation_Probability_2030', 'Risk_Category'

## Hypotheses/Questions 

1. Jobs requiring higher education have lower automation probability. 
2. Higher AI exposure reduces automation risk.
3. Higher-paying jobs have lower automation probability.
4. Jobs in high-tech-growth fields with high AI exposure are at higher risk if automation probability is strong.
5. Jobs requiring more experience are less likely to be automated.
6. Jobs with higher AI exposure tend to have higher salaries.
7. Jobs in industries with rapid tech growth are at higher automation risk, especially if AI exposure is low.
